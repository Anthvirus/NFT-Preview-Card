## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap
- Vanilla CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

I learnt more on the effects of using Bootstrap and also how to align my margins and paddings to suit my work. I also learnt a lot about psoitioning items on a box.

### Continued development

- I want to keep learning CSS Flex and Grid systems, Tailwind-CSS, image editing, positioning and sizing of components.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.bootstrap.com) - This helped me for my styling and display. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
